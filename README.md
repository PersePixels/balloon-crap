# Balloon Crap
I Frankensteined a buncha code to make flying look less stupid.

Allows for extra passangers in the balloon without them ragdolling (via an invisible carpet in the basket), and a balloon burner pulling animation w/ chain, so ya dont just "sTAND there".

Mostly from [kibook's side saddle](https://github.com/kibook/redm-sidesaddle) and [balloon control scripts](https://github.com/kibook/redm-ballooncontrols) but put in a blender ðŸ˜‚

It can definitely be cleaned up n optimized but, I'm not really a coder, I just wanted the thing to do the thinG, so well, here ya go:
